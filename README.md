YPR â€“ Yaml, Python, Rust compiler development framework.
The YPR framework is designed to deliver a robust implementation of the Prolog language through a unique approach that combines three programming languages: Python, Rust, and YAML, along with a domain-specific language (DSL). At the top of the framework sits YAML, which defines and monitors the entire project and its architecture, including directory structures, module names, functions, and their interactions.

The project's components and their interactions are described in a DSL, which allows for a more expressive and succinct definition than YAML alone. This DSL not only improves the readability and maintainability of the project descriptions but also facilitates the automatic generation of Python and Rust source code, bridging the gap between high-level project definitions and the actual code that implements them.

The Prolog system is developed in stages, represented as "Prolog Lite" languages (P1, P2, ..., Px, ..., Pn), each progressively increasing in complexity and functionality. Python and Rust independently implement functionally equivalent units for each stage of the Prolog-lite sequence, with the DSL serving as a blueprint. The DSL definitions for each module reside in their respective YAML documents, making them easy to manage and update.

The YAML structure within the YPR framework includes Yx instances for each stage (Px), capturing the necessary information for generating language references. Additionally, there is a YRoot document that provides an overview of the P1...Pn series and their relationships, facilitating iterative development and refinement.

A key aspect of the YPR framework is the 100% syntax and semantic compatibility between each stage (Px) and the ultimate version (Pn) of the Prolog system. This property, known as the "Px Compatibility Rule," is crucial. It allows us to assert that a specific stage (Px) is incorrect if it fails to pass the Px Compatibility Rule, indicating that its code does not run in all higher-level stages.

In summary, the YPR framework combines YAML, Python, and Rust to develop a Prolog implementation, leveraging a DSL for expressive project definitions that can be used to generate source code. The framework ensures syntax and semantic compatibility, provides language references, and facilitates iterative development through a sequence of Prolog-lite stages. While the YPR framework has evolved to incorporate a DSL, YAML remains a primary tool for high-level project orchestration.
