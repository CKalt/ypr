Please read the following and then at the end I have a request:
-----------
REAMDE
------
PRoot.ypr

-----
P1.ypr

------
The request is to help me code a python program called codegen.py whose first task will be to create a project skeleton for a Px.ypr project in the python langauge.

I wish the program to take as it's first arguemtn a Px.ypr script, such as P1.ypr, and the create a directory called Px (P1 in the case of P1.ypr) and under that create a directory called python and under the python directory create a directory called src and in that directory create a stubbed version of the *.ydl file for each of the *.ydl files listed in the Px.ypr file.

In each of the  src/*.py file I wish a comment to be placed that reflects the goal of the script along with a file name. For example

src/shell.py

If the P1 directory already exists, inform the user it needs to be removed or moved and exit gracefully.
