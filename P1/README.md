The Python code provided for the Interactive, Parser, and Evaluator classes looks correct, and it should be able to correctly parse and evaluate the boolean logic expressions in expressions.txt.

Remember that when you're running this in the shell, you will need to use the correct command to load the file. So, for the Interactive shell, you would enter load_file expressions.txt.

Please note, however, that the current implementation of the parser is basic and assumes well-formed input. It doesn't handle error checking for malformed expressions or unbalanced parentheses. If you're looking to expand this project, implementing more robust error checking would be a good next step.

To run the program, use:

bash

python src/shell.py

When you see the prompt "Command: ", you can type your commands. For example, to evaluate an expression directly, you can input:

vbnet

Command: ,(true, false)

It will then evaluate the expression and print the result. To load expressions from a file, you can input:

makefile

Command: load_file expressions.txt

It will then load each line from the specified file, evaluate the expression, and print the result.
